# Security Policy

## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you discover a security vulnerability in Aikeya, please report it by opening a GitHub issue or contacting the maintainer directly.

Please include:
- A description of the vulnerability
- Steps to reproduce
- Potential impact
- Any suggested fixes (if applicable)

## Security Considerations

### API Key Storage

Aikeya stores API keys for LLM and TTS providers locally on your device. This means:

- Keys are stored locally on your device only
- Keys are not sent to any server other than the respective API providers
- Keys persist until you remove them in Settings or clear the app's data

**Recommendations:**
- Use Aikeya on trusted devices only
- Consider using API keys with usage limits when possible
- Remove API keys in Settings if using a shared device

### Client-Side Application

Aikeya stores all your data locally on your device. When self-hosting, chat and model-fetching requests are proxied through SvelteKit server-side API routes before reaching the provider. No data is stored server-side — the server acts only as a pass-through. When using the hosted version at aikeya.org, these requests pass through the deployment server in the same way.

### Third-Party Services

When you configure API keys, Aikeya communicates directly with:
- LLM providers (OpenAI, Anthropic, Google, etc.)
- TTS providers (ElevenLabs, OpenAI, etc.)

Please review the privacy policies and terms of service of any providers you choose to use.
