## What is Panther?

Panther is a Rust daemon that sits on your computer and acts as your personal AI assistant, reachable from any messaging app you already use. Send it a message on Telegram, Discord, Slack, or even email, and it reasons, executes tools, and responds from your own hardware.

It can run entirely on a local model through Ollama (zero data leaves your machine) or connect to any of twelve cloud providers when you need more capability. The provider is a single config value; the rest of the system does not change.

### System Flow

How a message travels from your phone to a response:

```
  User (Telegram / Discord / Slack / Email / Matrix / CLI)
         |
         | platform API / IMAP poll / WebSocket
         v
  +--------------+
  |   Bot Crate  |  Normalises raw platform events into InboundMessage structs.
  |  (Adapters)  |  Applies the per-channel allow_from whitelist.
  |              |  Discards unknown senders silently.
  +--------------+
         |
         | InboundMessage pushed onto MessageBus (tokio mpsc channel)
         v
  +--------------+
  |  Agent Crate |  Session identified by channel + chat_id.
  |  (Dispatcher)|  Per-session Semaphore serialises concurrent messages.
  |              |  History loaded, profile injected, context assembled.
  +--------------+
         |
         | LLMRequest: system prompt + history + all tool definitions
         v
  +-----------------+
  | Provider Router |  Routes to active provider (Ollama, OpenAI, etc.).
  |                 |  All twelve providers share the same trait interface.
  +-----------------+
         |
         | LLMResponse: text (final) or ToolCall list (continue loop)
         v
  +--------------+
  | Tool Loop    |  Executes requested tools via ToolRegistry.
  |              |  Results appended to message history.
  |              |  Repeats until text response or max_iterations reached.
  +--------------+
         |
         | OutboundMessage pushed onto output bus
         v
  +--------------------+
  | OutboundDispatcher |  Routes reply back to the originating channel.
  |                    |  Handles message chunking, file uploads, media.
  +--------------------+
         |
         v
  User receives response
```

### The Agent Loop

The reasoning loop (`crates/agent/src/loop.rs`) is the core of the system. Each turn works like this:

```
  Iteration 0
  +-----------+
  | Build     |  System prompt (OS, persona, profile, datetime)
  | context   |  + last N messages from history (memory_window)
  |           |  + definitions for all tools (built-in + MCP)
  +-----------+
       |
       v
  +-----------+
  | LLM call  |  POST to active provider endpoint.
  |           |  Timeout: 300s local, varies for cloud.
  +-----------+
       |
       +-- No tool calls --> emit final text, exit loop
       |
       v
  +-----------+
  | Tool      |  Tools run via ToolRegistry.
  | execution |  Results truncated to tool_result_truncation chars.
  |           |  Appended as `tool` role messages in context.
  +-----------+
       |
       | If send_progress = true, intermediate message sent to user now
       v
  Iteration 1 ... up to max_iterations (default: 40)

  If cap reached with no final text, agent sends an error and ends the turn.
```

Tool results go back into the conversation as `tool` role messages. The model sees its own prior calls and their outcomes, enabling multi-step chains: search the web, read a URL, write a file, confirm to the user, all in a single turn.

### Message Bus

The bot and agent layers are fully decoupled via a typed `MessageBus` built on Tokio MPSC channels:

```
  InboundMessage  { channel, sender_id, chat_id, content, media_path, image_b64 }
  OutboundMessage { channel, chat_id, content, file_path, is_progress, is_tool_hint }
```

The agent never imports the bot crate. The `channel` field on outbound messages is sufficient for the dispatcher to route replies correctly.

### Provider Router

All twelve providers implement a single async trait:

```rust
#[async_trait]
pub trait ProviderInterface: Send + Sync {
    async fn chat(&self, request: LLMRequest) -> PantherResult<LLMResponse>;
}
```

`ProviderRouter` holds one instance of every provider and dispatches to whichever is set as `active`. Switching providers is a config change and restart. Ollama uses the same OpenAI-compatible JSON format as the cloud adapters, so the same `oai_common` serialisation layer covers both.

### Sessions and Concurrency

Each unique `channel:chat_id` pair is an isolated session with its own history and lock:

```
  Telegram user A  ->  Session "telegram:111"  ->  own history, own semaphore
  Telegram user B  ->  Session "telegram:222"  ->  own history, own semaphore
  Discord user C   ->  Session "discord:333"   ->  own history, own semaphore
```

A `Semaphore(1)` per session serialises messages from the same chat. Different sessions run concurrently on the Tokio runtime. The daemon handles many users simultaneously with no configuration needed.

### Subagent Architecture

When the `spawn` tool is called, a full independent agent instance is created in a new Tokio task:

```
  Primary Agent
  |
  +-- spawn("task description") -------->  Subagent (Tokio task)
  |                                        - own ToolRegistry
  |   Primary continues normally           - own reasoning loop
  |                                        - shared ProviderRouter
  |                                        - no spawn / message tools
  |                                        |
  |<-- result sent to originating chat  ---+
```

Multiple subagents can run in parallel. Each is tracked by session so its handle can be cleaned up when done.

## LLM Providers

| Provider | Config key | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| **Ollama** | `ollama_host`, `ollama_model` | Local inference, default provider |
| **OpenAI** | `openai_key` | GPT-4o and all GPT variants |
| **Anthropic** | `anthropic_key` | Claude family |
| **OpenRouter** | `openrouter_key` | Single key for many models |
| **Gemini** | `gemini_key` | Google Gemini family |
| **Groq** | `groq_key` | Fast inference + Whisper transcription |
| **Mistral** | `mistral_key` | Mistral family |
| **DeepSeek** | `deepseek_key` | DeepSeek models |
| **xAI** | `xai_key` | Grok family |
| **TogetherAI** | `together_key` | Hosted open-weight models |
| **Perplexity** | `perplexity_key` | Online models with built-in search |
| **Cohere** | `cohere_key` | Command family |

`cloud_model` in config is the model string sent to all non-Ollama providers. Set it to the specific model you want (e.g. `claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022`, `gpt-4o`, `gemini-2.0-flash`).

<br/>

---

## Messaging Channels

### Telegram
The primary channel. Supports text, file uploads, voice messages (auto-transcribed), and photo attachments. Long responses are chunked automatically at the 4096-character limit.

### Discord
Uses Serenity via WebSocket gateway. Responds in guild channels or DMs where the bot token has access.

### Slack
Connects via Socket Mode using an app-level token. No public endpoint or webhook URL required.

### Email
Polls an IMAP mailbox (default every 30 seconds). Replies via SMTP with TLS. HTML emails are stripped to plain text before the agent sees them.

### Matrix
Works with any homeserver using an access token. `group_policy = "mention"` requires the bot to be addressed directly; `"all"` replies to every message in a room.

### CLI
An interactive terminal REPL. No external accounts needed. Useful for local testing or terminal-native workflows.

<br/>

---

## Built-in Tools

### Shell Execution
Runs commands via `sh -c` on Linux/macOS and PowerShell on Windows. A static blocklist covers the most destructive patterns (`rm -rf`, `mkfs`, `dd if=`, fork bombs, disk format commands). Configurable timeout, default 30 seconds.

### Filesystem
`read_file`, `write_file`, `edit_file`, `list_dir`. The edit tool does a safe single-occurrence string replace and refuses if the target appears more than once, preventing ambiguous edits. Home-relative `~/` paths expand correctly on all platforms.

### Web Search
Calls the Brave Search API and returns titles, URLs, and snippets. Requires `brave_api_key` in config.

### Web Fetch
Fetches a URL and strips HTML to plain readable text. Scripts, styles, and tags excluded. Returns up to 8000 characters by default.

### Media Capture

Capture works on all platforms through automatic fallback chains. Each method is tried in order; the first that succeeds is used.

**Screenshot**

| Platform | Fallback chain |
|---|---|
| Windows | ffmpeg gdigrab > PowerShell System.Windows.Forms > GDI32 P/Invoke |
| macOS | `screencapture` (native) |
| Linux | gnome-screenshot > scrot > spectacle > flameshot > ImageMagick import > ffmpeg x11grab > grim/wayshot |

**Webcam**

| Platform | Fallback chain |
|---|---|
| Windows | ffmpeg dshow > Python OpenCV > VLC > WinRT MediaCapture |
| macOS | imagesnap > ffmpeg avfoundation |
| Linux | ffmpeg v4l2 > streamer |

**Audio**

| Platform | Fallback chain |
|---|---|
| Windows | MCI/winmm.dll (native, no deps required) > ffmpeg dshow > ffmpeg wasapi > Python sounddevice |
| macOS | ffmpeg avfoundation > rec (sox) |
| Linux | ffmpeg pulse > ffmpeg pipewire > ffmpeg alsa > arecord > parecord |

**Screen Recording**

| Platform | Fallback chain |
|---|---|
| Windows | ffmpeg gdigrab > PowerShell frame capture + ffmpeg/opencv assembly |
| macOS | ffmpeg avfoundation |
| Linux | ffmpeg x11grab > wf-recorder/wl-screenrec > recordmydesktop |

Captured files are automatically sent back to the chat as file uploads.

### Clipboard
Read from or write to the system clipboard. `pbpaste`/`pbcopy` on macOS, PowerShell `Get-Clipboard`/`Set-Clipboard` on Windows, `xclip`/`xsel`/`wl-paste` on Linux.

### System Information
Reports CPU, RAM, disk, battery, uptime, hostname, network interfaces, running processes, open windows, and display info. Queryable by category or all at once.

### Cron Scheduling
Three schedule types: an exact timestamp (`at`), a repeating interval in milliseconds (`every`), and a 5-field cron expression with optional timezone (`cron`). Jobs persist across restarts. One-off jobs can auto-delete after running.

### Spawn
Delegates a task to an independent background subagent. The primary agent is not blocked while it runs.

### MCP
Routes tool calls to external MCP server processes over stdio JSON-RPC 2.0. Tools from all configured servers are listed at startup alongside built-ins.

### Custom Skills
Any executable in `~/.panther/skills/` is registered as a callable tool. Input via `PANTHER_INPUT` env var, output via stdout, 30-second timeout.

### Activity Journal
Every conversation turn — user message and agent reply — is appended to an append-only NDJSON log at `~/.panther/workspace/activity_journal.ndjson`. Each record carries a UTC timestamp, session key, role, and content. The `query_activity` tool exposes this log to the agent, accepting free-form natural language time expressions and returning all matching records within a configurable time window.

**Supported time expressions (non-exhaustive):**

| Expression | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `1 hour ago` | 60 minutes before now |
| `2pm yesterday` | 14:00 the previous calendar day |
| `3 days ago` | Same time of day, 3 days back |
| `5 days ago at 3pm` | 15:00 five calendar days ago |
| `this morning` | 09:00 today |
| `this afternoon` | 14:00 today |
| `a week ago` | 7 days before now |
| `30 minutes ago` | 30 minutes before now |
| `two hours ago` | Word numbers are resolved |

The `window_minutes` parameter (default 60, max 1440) controls the width of the search window centred on the resolved anchor time.

### System Monitor
A background file system watcher that records every file event on your machine into the same activity journal. Uses the OS-native watch API on each platform — `inotify` on Linux, `FSEvents` on macOS, `ReadDirectoryChangesW` on Windows — via the `notify` crate, with no polling overhead.

**What it captures:**

| Event | Description |
|---|---|
| `CREATED` | New file or directory appeared at a path |
| `MODIFIED` | File content changed (write saves, edits, overwrites) |
| `DELETED` | File or directory removed |
| `RENAMED` | File or directory moved or renamed |

Access-time and metadata-only events are intentionally ignored to avoid noise from routine file reads.

**Content extraction** is performed automatically for supported file types when a file is created or modified:

| Format | Method |
|---|---|
| Plain text, code, config, data | UTF-8 read, truncated to `max_content_chars` |
| PDF | Pure-Rust `lopdf` parser — no external binary required |
| DOCX | ZIP extraction + `quick-xml` parsing of `word/document.xml` |

**Debouncing** collapses rapid bursts of events on the same path (e.g. autosave firing 20 times per second) into a single record. The default debounce window is 500 ms and is configurable.

**Self-exclusion** — the `~/.panther/` directory is always excluded from watching to prevent journal writes from generating new journal events.

<br/>

---

## Security

**Access control.** Every channel has an `allow_from` list. Messages from senders not on the list are discarded before reaching the agent. An empty list accepts everyone; use only for personal, isolated setups.

**Command blocking.** The exec tool has a static blocklist for unrecoverable operations. This is defence-in-depth, not a sandbox. The agent runs under your user account. Do not run Panther as root or with elevated privileges.

**Credentials.** Keys live in `~/.panther/config.toml`. Set permissions to `600` on Linux/macOS. Keys are only transmitted to the corresponding provider endpoint.

**Network exposure.** Panther opens no listening ports. It connects outward only. There is no inbound attack surface.

**Local mode.** With Ollama and the CLI channel, no data leaves the machine at any layer.

**Honest note.** Giving an LLM shell access carries real risk if adversarial content enters through fetched web pages or tool results. The blocklist reduces the worst-case outcomes but is not exhaustive. Run Panther under a least-privilege account.

## Local-Only Mode

To run with absolutely no external network calls:

```sh
# 1. Install Ollama and pull a model
ollama pull llama3
```

```toml
# 2. Config
active_provider = "ollama"
ollama_host     = "http://localhost:11434"
ollama_model    = "llama3"
# Leave all cloud keys and brave_api_key empty

[cli]
enabled = true
```

Tool calling in local mode depends on the model. Reliable choices: `llama3`, `mistral`, `qwen2.5`. Smaller models may produce malformed tool calls; `max_iterations` acts as a circuit breaker.

## MCP Server Integration

Any MCP-compatible tool server can be connected via config:

```toml
[[mcp_servers]]
name    = "my-tools"
command = "python"
args    = ["/path/to/server.py"]
```

Panther spawns the server as a child process and communicates via stdio JSON-RPC 2.0. At startup it calls `tools/list` on each server and registers the results alongside built-ins. On Windows, servers launch via `cmd /C` for correct environment resolution.

## Custom Skills

Place any executable script in `~/.panther/skills/`. Panther registers it as a callable tool.

- Input passed via `PANTHER_INPUT` environment variable
- Output read from stdout
- Hard timeout: 30 seconds
- Any language that produces an executable file works

```python
#!/usr/bin/env python3
# ~/.panther/skills/weather.py
import os, requests
city = os.environ.get("PANTHER_INPUT", "London")
print(requests.get(f"https://wttr.in/{city}?format=3").text)
```

```sh
chmod +x ~/.panther/skills/weather.py
```

## Memory and Persistence

```
~/.panther/
├── config.toml               # Main config (atomic writes via tmp-then-rename)
├── profile/                  # User profile: name, preferences, projects, style
├── history/                  # Per-session conversation logs (JSON)
├── chats/
│   └── known_chats.json      # channel:chat_id to session ID map
├── skills/                   # Custom skill scripts
└── workspace/
    ├── activity_journal.ndjson   # Append-only timestamped log of all activity
    └── memory/
        ├── MEMORY.md             # Long-term consolidated memory
        └── HISTORY.md            # Summarised session history entries
```

The user profile is injected into the system prompt on every turn, so the agent maintains consistent knowledge of your preferences and projects across sessions and restarts.

When a session's history grows large, the agent runs a consolidation pass that summarises older exchanges into a compact form, keeping context size manageable without losing important facts.

The activity journal grows continuously as long as the daemon is running. Every user message, agent reply, and file system event (when system monitor is enabled) is appended as a single JSON line with a UTC timestamp. The journal is never truncated automatically — manage its size manually if needed by archiving or deleting the file; a new one will be created on next write.

## Performance

| Metric | Typical value |
|---|---|
| Startup time (no MCP) | under 1 second |
| Idle memory footprint | 20-60 MB |
| Response latency (Ollama + GPU) | 2-10 seconds |
| Response latency (cloud) | varies by provider and model |
| Concurrent sessions | unlimited (one Tokio task per session) |
| Built-in tool overhead | negligible (native async Rust) |
| MCP / skill tool overhead | 100-500 ms (subprocess IPC) |

Set `send_progress = true` to receive intermediate status messages during long tool chains so the chat does not go silent while work is happening.

## Activity Intelligence

Panther maintains a continuous, queryable record of everything that happens on your machine while the daemon is running. This is composed of two complementary subsystems that feed a single shared log.

### How It Works

Every event — whether a message you sent, a reply the agent produced, or a file that changed on your filesystem — is appended as a single JSON line to `~/.panther/workspace/activity_journal.ndjson`. Each line carries:

```json
{
  "timestamp": "2025-03-07T14:23:11.042Z",
  "session_key": "telegram:123456789",
  "role": "user",
  "content": "..."
}
```

The `role` field is one of `user`, `agent`, or `system`. Conversation turns use `user` and `agent`. File system events use `system`.

The `query_activity` tool is registered alongside all other built-in tools. When you ask a time-based question, the agent calls it automatically — no special command or syntax needed.

### Conversation Timeline

Every message you send and every reply the agent produces is recorded with a precise UTC timestamp at the moment of processing. The record captures the full content of each turn, truncated at 512 characters to keep the journal compact.

**Example queries:**
```
What did we talk about this morning?
What was I asking you about 2 hours ago?
What did you help me with yesterday afternoon?
Summarise our conversation from 3 days ago.
```

### File System Timeline

When `[system_monitor] enabled = true`, a background watcher attaches to every path listed in `watch_paths` and streams file events into the same journal. Events are recorded with the full path, event type, file extension, file size, and a content preview for supported formats.

**Example queries:**
```
What files did I create on my Desktop in the last hour?
What was I working on yesterday at 2pm?
Give me a summary of everything I changed in ~/Projects this morning.
What did I write in that document 3 days ago?
Did I delete anything on my Desktop last week?
What files changed in the last 30 minutes?
```

### Time Window Mechanics

Every query resolves to an anchor timestamp and a symmetric window around it. The default window is 60 minutes (30 minutes before and after the anchor). Pass `window_minutes` to widen or narrow it.

```
"1 hour ago"          → anchor: now - 1h,  window: ±30 min
"2pm yesterday"       → anchor: yesterday 14:00, window: ±30 min
"3 days ago"          → anchor: 3 days back at noon, window: ±30 min
"5 days ago at 3pm"   → anchor: 5 days back at 15:00, window: ±30 min
```

If results are sparse, ask the agent to widen the window: *"check the last 3 hours around that time"*.

### Query Response Structure

Results are split into two labelled sections:

```
=== CONVERSATION (4 messages) ===

[2025-03-07 14:21:03] [user]
What files did I create earlier?

[2025-03-07 14:21:09] [agent]
I'll check the activity journal for you...

=== FILE SYSTEM EVENTS (7 events) ===

[2025-03-07 14:15:42]
action: CREATED
path: /home/user/Desktop/report.docx
type: docx
size: 0 bytes

[2025-03-07 14:18:03]
action: MODIFIED
path: /home/user/Desktop/report.docx
type: docx
size: 14823 bytes
content_preview:
Q1 Financial Summary

Total revenue for the quarter reached...
```

### Platform Support

The file system watcher uses the OS-native kernel API on every platform. There is no polling. Events arrive in real time with sub-second latency.

| Platform | Kernel API | Crate backend |
|---|---|---|
| Linux | inotify | `notify` (inotify backend) |
| macOS | FSEvents | `notify` (kqueue/FSEvents backend) |
| Windows | ReadDirectoryChangesW | `notify` (windows backend) |
